Hi, Iâ€™m @siweli

I am currently a university student at UCB studying Computer Science. I am interested in programming casually as of right now but aim to build a career in it.
I mainly code in Python and tackle any problem first with Python but would like to learn other languages for the areas that Python does not perform well in.
